                    <p>
                        For most of my youth, the only things I took (somewhat) seriously in life were Taekwondo, Super Smash Bros, and learning the Korean language.
                        After realizing that my future was in my hands at age 15, my then-life tragectory of flunking high school looked bleak; I decided to start trying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But I was lost: no one had ever taught me how to study, let alone how those seemingly god-like A-students did.
                        So, in an act of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F">desperation / resourcefulness</a>, I leveraged the one system I knew well by applying the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190531214705/https://apps.ankiweb.net/">tools</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094543/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-it-takes-to-be-great" >mindset</a> of my language learning journey towards every possible facet of my life.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After two years of trial and error with my newfound conviction, I not only managed to get accepted into both the University of Toronto and McGill University, but become one of the three <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Cadets">Royal Canadian Air Cadets</a> in my local squadron to pass its <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_pilot_licence">private pilot</a> ground school program<!--<sup><a href="#footnote-a">a</a></sup>--> that year.

                    <h2><span>2021 &#8594; 2024:&nbsp;</span>Rowing @ UofT</h2>

                    <p>
                        After the pandemic paused my martial arts journey, I was inspired to pursue high-performance sport again after watching <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mnoJ7XdD7XU?si=z2wKpi8Nf_pZOFbo&t=7021">Kristian Blummenfelt win the 2021 Olympic men's triathlon</a>.
                        I chose rowing for its relatively low barrier to entry and joined UofT's novice program upon begining my studies in 2021, where I spent all my free time immersed in the sport in one way or another.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231215225305/https://varsityblues.ca/sports/rowing/roster/nicholas-garcia/15886">making the Varsity Blues team</a> in 2022, the sport took me on an invaluable journey where I learned to manage self-doubt, perform under stress, and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929034342/https://log.concept2.com/profile/1552101">hold myself accountable</a> to a team; alongside meeting some of the coolest people ever during my racing travels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        More than anything, rowing was the first time in my life I'd ever commited myself 100% to something, holding nothing back. 
                        By the time I quit the sport in 2024, I was grateful it showed me where my true mental and physical limits lay; that I wasn't made of glass.

                        It inspired me to try my hand at building a business using my (then-limited) skillset to start a web design agency with a close friend.

                        Being our first entrepreneurial venture, I learned so many things while solving problems I hadn't expected to face: How does one accept payment from customers? What about taxes? And how does one actually get customers without social media?
                    </p>                

                    <p>
                        Of course we didn't make any money, but I was (and still am) proud in having not only sincerely attempted my first business endeavour (officially shedding the title of <i>'wantrepreneur'</i> ) and took my failure with stride.

                        When I met one of my now-closest friends, Simon, he was very academically inept and struggling to adjust to the university-level academic workload.
                        I was thriving academically, so I taught him the study method I'd developed over the previous four years.
                        What followed was his meteoric rise to academic splendor that I could hardly believe, with him even adding his own tweaks to the method.
                        Seeing our method's success replicate with other friends, we decided to make a business out of selling <a target="_blank" href="https://uoftearless.com/products/twohourmethod">our study method</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Simon and I put everything into building <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251001044830/https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=UofTears">UofTear</a>less from the ground up using <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250927025505/https://www.acquisition.com/books">Alex Hormozi's books</a> as our guide: from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/uoftearless">social media</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241222194611/https://www.uoftearless.com/pages/how-it-works.php">online presence</a>, to product development and offer refinement, to lead management and on-boarding, to incorporation, and with the mental pressure of uncertainty on a scale we'd never felt before.

                    <p>
                        After achieving success with our first real sales, I eventually chose to leave the company to finish my <a href="#csb498">research project</a>.

                        I joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://guttman.csb.utoronto.ca/">Guttman Laboratory of Pathogen Genomics & Evolution</a> under a grant to complete my <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250822132917/https://csb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-course/csb498y1/">undergraduate capstone research project</a>.
                        The goal was to develop a new methodology for characterising plants' responses to pathogenic bacteria by measuring the plant's genetic responses.
                        To save space, <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OoQhIDwHxykZG604AMIwy_fwzbzszNU/view?usp=sharing">here is the link to my full report</a> if you're interested in the technicalities.

                    <p>
                        Despite the project's immense unforeseen difficulty and painstaking (13 months) length, it was not only succesful, to my relief, but earned <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814230611/https://csb.utoronto.ca/excellence-in-research-shown-at-end-of-year-poster-session-for-undergraduate-projects/">a departamental award</a> for being among the best-presented projects of the 2025 student-researchers.

                    <p>
                        Although I was, and still am, grateful for having had this opportunity, the project's successes and the external validation they brought didn't make up for my growing disillusionment with, and unfulfillment within, academia.
