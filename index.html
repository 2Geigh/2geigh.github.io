                    <p>
                        For most of my youth, the only things I took (somewhat) seriously in life were Taekwondo, Super Smash Bros, and learning the Korean langauge.
                        After realizing that my future was in my hands at age 15, my then-life tragectory of flunking high school looked bleak; I decided to start trying.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But I was lost: no one had ever taught me how to study, let alone how those seemingly God-like A-students did.
                        In an act of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F">desperation / resourcefulness</a>, I leveraged the one system I knew well by applying the <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190531214705/https://apps.ankiweb.net/">tools</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094543/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-it-takes-to-be-great" >mindset</a> of my language learning journey towards every possible facet of my life.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After two years of trial and error with my newfound conviction, I not only managed to get accepted into the University of Toronto and McGill University, but become one of the three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Cadets">Royal Canadian Air Cadets</a> in my local squadron to pass its private pilot ground school program<sup><a href="#footnote-a">a</a></sup> that year.

                    <p>
                        After the pandemic paused my martial arts journey, I was inspired to pursue high-performance sport again after watching <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/mnoJ7XdD7XU?si=z2wKpi8Nf_pZOFbo&t=7021">Kristian Blummenfelt win the 2021 Olympic men's triathlon</a>.
                        I chose rowing for its relatively low barrier to entry and joined UofT's novice program upon begining my studies in 2021, where I spent all my free time immersed in the sport in one way or another.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231215225305/https://varsityblues.ca/sports/rowing/roster/nicholas-garcia/15886">making the Varsity Blues team</a> in 2022, the sport took me on an invaluable journey where I learned to manage self-doubt, perform under stress, and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929034342/https://log.concept2.com/profile/1552101">hold myself accountable</a> to a team; alongside meeting some of the coolest people ever during my racing travels.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        More than anything, rowing was the first time in my life I'd ever commited myself 100% to something, holding nothing back. 
                        By the time I quit the sport in 2024, I was grateful it showed me where my true mental and physical limits lay; that I wasn't made of glass.

                    <p>
                        When I met one of my now-closest friends, Simon, he was very academically inept and struggling to adjust to the university-level academic workload.
                        I was thriving academically, so I taught him the study method I'd developed over the previous four years.
                        What followed was his meteoric rise to academic splendor that I could hardly believe, with him even adding his own tweaks to the method.
                        Seeing our method's success replicate with other friends, we decided to make a business out of selling <a target="_blank" href="https://uoftearless.com/products/twohourmethod">our study method</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Simon and I put everything into building <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251001044830/https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=UofTears">UofTear</a>less from the ground up using <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250927025505/https://www.acquisition.com/books">Alex Hormozi's books</a> as our guide: From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/uoftearless">social media</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241222194611/https://www.uoftearless.com/pages/how-it-works.php">online presence</a>, to product development and offer refinement, to lead management and on-boarding, to incorporation, and with the mental pressure of uncertainty on a scale we'd never felt before.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After achieving success with our first real sales, I eventually chose to leave the company to finish my <a href="#csb498">research project</a>.

                    <p>
                        I joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://guttman.csb.utoronto.ca/">Guttman Laboratory of Pathogen Genomics & Evolution</a> under a grant to complete my <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250822132917/https://csb.utoronto.ca/undergraduate-course/csb498y1/">undergraduate capstone research project</a>.
                        The goal was to develop a new methodology for characterising plants' responses to pathogenic bacteria by measuring the plant's genetic responses.
                        To save space, <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OoQhIDwHxykZG604AMIwy_fwzbzszNU/view?usp=sharing">here</a> is the link to my full report if you're interested in the technicalities.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the project's immense unforeseen difficulty and painstaking (13 months) length, it was not only succesful, to my relief, but earned <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814230611/https://csb.utoronto.ca/excellence-in-research-shown-at-end-of-year-poster-session-for-undergraduate-projects/">a departamental award</a> for being among the best-presented projects of the 2025 student-researchers.

                    <p>
                        Although I was, and still am, grateful for having had this opportunity, the project's successes and the external validation they brought didn't make up for my growing disillusionment with, and unfulfillment within, academia.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <p>
                        Most of all: I will forever be thankful for having learned with this project was that academia was not for me. This realisation gave myself the permission and clarity to focus on my desired path: entrepreneurship.

            <p>
                All my different life projects, from trying to become an Olympic rower, to a biology researcher, to an entreprenur in the web design and education spaces, has allowed me to realize which doors in life I'm okay with closing; affirming my conviction towards those I keep open.
                <br>
                Through all my experiences, I still consider entrepreneurship my calling. But I now have both the wisdom to see the highest-leverage skillset that I can develop from my previously-established (if elementary) skillset is sales and software development, and the patience to learn before I earn.
                <br>
                So that's the plan: learn to develop software products while working in sales to gain the necessary skillset to sell my product.<br> I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this far.
