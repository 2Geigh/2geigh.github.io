            <p>
                After gaining consciousness at age ~15, I started to actually work for my future.
                Up until that point, the only things I'd taken seriously in life were Taekwondo, learning the Korean langauge, and Super Smash Bros.
                
                Realizing that my future was in my hands and that my current life tragectory of a high school dropout looked bleak, I decided to start trying in school.
                But I had no idea where to start. No one ever taught me how A students actually study, and none of my friends at the time were top students either.
                In an act of resourcefulness I leveraged the one thing I knew well: I tried applying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190531214705/https://apps.ankiweb.net/">tools</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094543/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-it-takes-to-be-great" >mindset</a> of my language learning journey towards everything else in my life.
                
                It didn't start out well (my grades actually decreased at first), but I was convinced to see it through.
                After two years of trial in error, I not only dragged myself to the top academic percentile of my high school to get accepted into the University of Toronto and McGill University, but also finished the Royal Canadian Air Cadet private pilot ground school program<sup><a href="#footnote-a">A</a></sup>.

                Following the pandemic-induced closure of the Taekwondo academy I attended, I was inspired to pursue high-performance sport again upon watching Kristian Blummenfelt win the 2021 Olympic men's triathlon.
                I chose rowing for its relatively low barrier to entry and joined UofT's novice progra upon begining my studies in 2021, where I spent all my free time immersed in the sport in one way or another.
                <br>
                After making the Varsity Blues team in 2022, the sport took me on an invaluable journey where I learned to manage self-doubt, perform under stress, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929034342/https://log.concept2.com/profile/1552101">hold myself accountable</a> to a team; alongside meeting some of the coolest people eve during my racing travels.
                <br>
                More than anything, rowing was the first time in my life I'd ever commited myself 100% to something, holding nothing back. 
                By the time I quit the sport in 2024, I was grateful it showed me where my true mental and physical limits lay; that I wasn't made of glass.

                In retrospect, reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18872437-the-millionaire-fastlane">MJ Demarco's <i>The Millionaire Fastlane</i></a> in May 2023 was one of my life's greatest inflection points.
                The book opened my curiosity towards something I had never seriously considered before: entrepreneurship.
                I was inspired to try my hand at starting a successful business as the author had, leveraging my (at the time overstated) skillset in front-end web development to start a web design agency with a close friend.
                
                Being my first entrepreneurial venture, I learned so many things while solving problems I hadn't expected to face: How does one accept payment from customers? What about taxes? And how does one actually get customers without social media?

                We failed hard, of course, but I was (and still am) proud in having not only sincerely attempted my first business endeavour, but took my failure with stride.

                The biggest take-away lessons I got were:<ul>
                    <li>How to get leads via outbound cold-calling</li>
                    <li>How much work it actually takes to build a business</li>
                    <li>What to look for in a co-founder</li>
                    <li>When to quit</li>

            <p>
                I met one of my closest friends, Simon, on the UofT rowing team when he was very academically inept.
                Because I was doing excellent academically, I decided to show him the study method I'd develed over the previous four years.
                What followed was a meteoric rise to academic splendor like I'd never seen before, even successfuly adding his own tweaks to what I taught him. From then on we knew we had something special and decided to make a business out of selling our study method.
                <br>
                Simon and I spent every free minute of our time building what would become UofTearless from the ground up: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/uoftearless">social media</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241222194611/https://www.uoftearless.com/pages/how-it-works.php">online presence</a>, product development and offer refinement, lead management and on-boarding, incorporation, and the mental pressure of uncertainty on a scale we'd never felt before even in rowing.
                <br>

                It's difficult to even quantify the myriad of lessons I got from building this business, but here's my attempt:<ul>
                    <li>How to frame an offer</li>
                    <li>How to close warm leads</li>
                    <li>How to copywrite</li>
                    <li>Sales and IT problems are the types I enjoy solving the most in my work.</li>
                </ul>

                After eight months I chose to leave the company as I found the particular problems we were solving unfulfilling despite achieving material success (our first real sales and word-of-mouth advertising).
                Since leaving Simon has scaled the business to a degree that has elated me to see, and I was able to focus on finishing the <a href="#csb498">research project</a> I'd been concurently working on at the same time.

            In 2024 I joined the <a href="https://guttman.csb.utoronto.ca/">Guttman Laboratory of Pathogen Genomics & Evolution</a> under a departamental grant to complete my undergraduate capstone research project.
            The goal was to develop a new methodology for characterising plants' responses to pathogenic bacteria by measuring the plant's genetic responses.
            To avoid bloating this page with technical jargon, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OoQhIDwHxykZG604AMIwy_fwzbzszNU/view?usp=sharing">here</a> is the link to my full report if you're interested in the technicalities of the project.
            <br>
            Despite how difficult (with many sleepless nights) and painstaking (over 13 months starting in February 2024) the project was, to my surprise I not only was the project succesful but earned <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250814230611/https://csb.utoronto.ca/excellence-in-research-shown-at-end-of-year-poster-session-for-undergraduate-projects/">a departamental award</a> for being among the best-presented projects among 2025 students-researchers. As grateful as I am to have had the opportunity to work on the project, the external success and validation didn't make up for the lack of fulfilment the project brought.
            <br>
            The greatest thing that I will forever be thankful for having learned with this project was that academia was not for me. This realisation gave myself the permission and clarity to focus on my desired path: entrepreneurship.

            <p>
                All my different life projects, from trying to become an Olympic rower, to a biology researcher, to an entreprenur in the web design and education spaces, has allowed me to realize which doors in life I'm okay with closing; affirming my conviction towards those I keep open.
                <br>
                Through all my experiences, I still consider entrepreneurship my calling. But I now have both the wisdom to see the highest-leverage skillset that I can develop from my previously-established (if elementary) skillset is sales and software development, and the patience to learn before I earn.
                <br>
                So that's the plan: learn to develop software products while working in sales to gain the necessary skillset to sell my product.<br> I greatly appreciate you taking the time to read this far.
