                <li>My resume piqued your interest</li>
                <li>My social media engaged you enough to click my link</li>

            Either way, I hope to show you here a more wholistic picture of who I am via a timeline-of-sorts of my life's endeavours.

            <h2>2019: From D-student to getting into UofT</h2>
            <p>
                After gaining consciousness at age ~15, I started to actually work for my future.
                Up until that point, the only things I'd taken seriously in life were Taekwondo, learning the Korean langauge, and Super Smash Bros.
                
                Realizing that my future was in my hands and that my current life tragectory of a high school dropout looked bleak, I decided to start trying in school.
                But I had no idea where to start. No one ever taught me how A students actually study, and none of my friends at the time were top students either.
                In an act of resourcefulness I leveraged the one thing I knew well: I tried applying the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190531214705/https://apps.ankiweb.net/">tools</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094543/http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/series/what-it-takes-to-be-great" >mindset</a> of my language learning journey towards everything else in my life.
                
                It didn't start out well (my grades actually decreased at first), but I was convinced to see it through.
                After two years of trial in error, I not only dragged myself to the top academic percentile of my high school to get accepted into the University of Toronto and McGill University, but also finished the Royal Canadian Air Cadet private pilot ground school program<sup><a href="#footnote-a">A</a></sup>.

            <h2>2021: Started rowing at UofT</h2>
            <!-- FIND WIRC POST-2K PIC -->
            <p>
                Following the pandemic-induced closure of the Taekwondo academy I attended, I was inspired to pursue high-performance sport again upon watching Kristian Blummenfelt win the 2021 Olympic men's triathlon.
                I chose rowing for its relatively low barrier to entry and joined UofT's novice progra upon begining my studies in 2021, where I spent all my free time immersed in the sport in one way or another.
                <br>
                After making the Varsity Blues team in 2022, the sport took me on an invaluable journey where I learned to manage self-doubt, perform under stress, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929034342/https://log.concept2.com/profile/1552101">hold myself accountable</a> to a team; alongside meeting some of the coolest people eve during my racing travels.
                <br>
                More than anything, rowing was the first time in my life I'd ever commited myself 100% to something, holding nothing back. 
                By the time I quit the sport in 2024, I was grateful it showed me where my true mental and physical limits lay; that I wasn't made of glass.
