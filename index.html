            You're either here because:<ul>
                <li>My resume piqued your interest</li>
                <li>My social media engaged you enough to click my link</li>
                <li>You're interested in who I am enough to look me up</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Either way, I hope to show you here a more wholistic picture of who I am via a timeline-of-sorts of my life's endeavours.
